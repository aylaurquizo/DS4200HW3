Styling and Customizations:

Custom Fonts: I used custom Google Fonts for my website. I chose Fredoka One for the headings because of its bubbly and bold style. Then I chose Nunito for the body text because of its easy readability.

Color Scheme: I chose a dark indigo color (#4a47a3) for the nav and headings. Then I used a nice pink color (#ff4081) for the links and highlights. I then used a bright blue (#00b0ff) for the contact buttons. Then finally I used a light purple (#faf8ff) for the background.

Layout Adjustments: I customized the layout with a container class to center the content. I used a max-width of 900px to add some padding and then a box-shadow to make the movie/show cards look like they are floating. On the "Ayla's Picks" page, I used a flexbox layout to automatically align the anime cards on the grid.
